The following heatmap shows that most bikes are used Monday - Friday from 7am to 10 am as well as 5pm to 7pm via the darker blues in the visual. This is most likely reflective of individuals who use Citi Bike to commute to and from work. On Saturdays and Sundays ridership is more spread out throughout the day as shown through the darker blue on the heatmap between 10am and 8pm during these days.

# Summary

Overall, there were definitely trends in Citi Bike data from New York City involving trip duration, gender, user type, and riding time.

This additional data would be best visualized as a bar or pie chart.
